# Archetype Patterns

Archetype Patterns
The book "Enterprise Patterns and MDA: Building Better Software with Archetype Patterns and UML" describes several software design patterns called archetypes. These archetypes provide a standardized and scalable approach to modeling different concepts in enterprise systems.

The archetypes described in the book include:

## Address Archetype
The Address Archetype provides a standardized and scalable approach to modeling addresses in enterprise systems. It encapsulates the concept of address in a separate layer, making it easier to modify and maintain.

## Party Archetype
The Party Archetype provides a standardized and scalable approach to modeling parties in enterprise systems. It encapsulates the concept of party in a separate layer, making it easier to modify and maintain.

## Product Archetype
The Product Archetype provides a standardized and scalable approach to modeling products in enterprise systems. It encapsulates the concept of product in a separate layer, making it easier to modify and maintain.

## Money Archetype
The Money Archetype provides a standardized and scalable approach to modeling monetary values in enterprise systems. It encapsulates the concept of money in a separate layer, making it easier to modify and maintain.

## Order Archetype
The Order Archetype provides a standardized and scalable approach to modeling orders in enterprise systems. It encapsulates the concept of order in a separate layer, making it easier to modify and maintain.

## Rule Archetype
The Rule Archetype provides a standardized and scalable approach to modeling rules in enterprise systems. It encapsulates the concept of rule in a separate layer, making it easier to modify and maintain.

Each of these archetypes provides several advantages, including separation of concerns, scalability, flexibility, consistency, and reusability. However, they may not be suitable for all enterprise systems, particularly those with simple requirements. Implementing these archetypes may require additional development time and effort, but can result in a more maintainable and adaptable system in the long run.
