# Product Archetype
The Product Archetype is a software design pattern described in the book "Enterprise Patterns and MDA: Building Better Software with Archetype Patterns and UML." This pattern provides a standardized and scalable approach to modeling products in enterprise systems. It encapsulates the concept of product in a separate layer, making it easier to modify and maintain. The key concepts of the Product Archetype include product types, product variants, and product configurations. Product types can be modeled as objects, and product variants can be used to represent different versions of a product. Product configurations can be used to specify the characteristics of a product. The Product Archetype provides several advantages, including separation of concerns, scalability, flexibility, consistency, and reusability. However, it may not be suitable for all enterprise systems, particularly those with simple product requirements. Implementing the Product Archetype may require additional development time and effort.
