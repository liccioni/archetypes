# Quantity Archetype
The Quantity Archetype is a software design pattern described in the book "Enterprise Patterns and MDA: Building Better Software with Archetype Patterns and UML." This pattern provides a standardized and scalable approach to modeling quantities in enterprise systems. It encapsulates the concept of quantity in a separate layer, making it easier to modify and maintain. The key concepts of the Quantity Archetype include quantity types, quantity ranges, and quantity manipulations. Quantity types can be modeled as objects, and quantity ranges can be used to limit the values of a quantity. Quantity manipulations can be used to perform arithmetic operations on quantities. The Quantity Archetype provides several advantages, including separation of concerns, scalability, flexibility, consistency, and reusability. However, it may not be suitable for all enterprise systems, particularly those with simple quantity requirements. Implementing the Quantity Archetype may require additional development time and effort.
