# Order Archetype
The Order Archetype is a software design pattern described in the book "Enterprise Patterns and MDA: Building Better Software with Archetype Patterns and UML." This pattern provides a standardized and scalable approach to modeling orders in enterprise systems. It encapsulates the concept of order in a separate layer, making it easier to modify and maintain. The key concepts of the Order Archetype include order types, order items, and order manipulations. Order types can be modeled as objects, and order items can be used to represent the products or services being ordered. Order manipulations can be used to perform operations on orders, such as validation, fulfillment, and cancellation. The Order Archetype provides several advantages, including separation of concerns, scalability, flexibility, consistency, and reusability. However, it may not be suitable for all enterprise systems, particularly those with simple order requirements. Implementing the Order Archetype may require additional development time and effort.
