# Money Archetype
The Money Archetype is a software design pattern described in the book "Enterprise Patterns and MDA: Building Better Software with Archetype Patterns and UML." This pattern provides a standardized and scalable approach to modeling monetary values in enterprise systems. It encapsulates the concept of money in a separate layer, making it easier to modify and maintain. The key concepts of the Money Archetype include currency types, money values, and money manipulations. Currency types can be modeled as objects, and money values can be used to represent the amount of money in a specific currency. Money manipulations can be used to perform arithmetic operations on money values. The Money Archetype provides several advantages, including separation of concerns, scalability, flexibility, consistency, and reusability. However, it may not be suitable for all enterprise systems, particularly those with simple monetary requirements. Implementing the Money Archetype may require additional development time and effort.
