# Rule Archetype
The Rule Archetype is a software design pattern described in the book "Enterprise Patterns and MDA: Building Better Software with Archetype Patterns and UML." This pattern provides a standardized and scalable approach to modeling complex business rules and logic in enterprise systems. It encapsulates business rules and logic in a separate layer, making it easier to modify and maintain. The key concepts of the Rule Archetype include rules, rule sets, and a rule engine. Rules can be modeled as objects, and rule sets can be modeled as collections of rules. The rule engine is a separate component that evaluates rules against specific data. The Rule Archetype provides several advantages, including separation of concerns, scalability, flexibility, consistency, and reusability. However, it may not be suitable for all enterprise systems, particularly those with simple business rules and logic. Implementing the Rule Archetype may require additional development time and effort.
