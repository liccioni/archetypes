# Address Archetype
The Address Archetype is a software design pattern described in the book "Enterprise Patterns and MDA: Building Better Software with Archetype Patterns and UML." This pattern provides a standardized and scalable approach to modeling addresses in enterprise systems. It encapsulates the concept of address in a separate layer, making it easier to modify and maintain. The key concepts of the Address Archetype include address types, address formats, and address manipulations. Address types can be modeled as objects, and address formats can be used to represent the structure and organization of an address. Address manipulations can be used to perform operations on address data, such as validation, normalization, and parsing. The Address Archetype provides several advantages, including separation of concerns, scalability, flexibility, consistency, and reusability. However, it may not be suitable for all enterprise systems, particularly those with simple address requirements. Implementing the Address Archetype may require additional development time and effort.
